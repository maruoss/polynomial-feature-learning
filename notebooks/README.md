This directory contains experiments run on our model, in two settings.

The notebook `Many Monomials.ipynb` contains experiments regarding the explainability of networks using many more monomials than necessary, in a 1D setting.

The notebook `Many Inputs.ipynb` contains experiments regarding the explainability of networks when their input has more than 1 dimension.
